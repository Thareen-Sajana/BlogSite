            Sri Lanka and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached a preliminary agreement on an emergency
             loan to the crisis-hit country and a formal announcement will be made on Thursday, four sources with direct
              knowledge of the matter said.

            The island nation, struggling with its worst economic crisis
            in more than seven decades, had sought up to $3 billion from the IMF.

            Spokespersons for the IMF and the Sri Lankan government did
            not immediately respond to requests for comment.

            Staff-level agreements are typically subject to the approval of the IMF management and its
            executive board, after which the recipient nations get access to funds.

            A visiting IMF team held talks with Sri Lankan government officials, including the
            treasury secretary, late into the night on Tuesday to address concerns on the political front, the
            sources said. Most of the technical details had been agreed to beforehand.

            On the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, the United States stands 
            united with all those affected by the crime of enforced disappearance.  This practice is an egregious
             violation of human rights prohibited under international law, yet continues to be used to silence dissent 
            and attack civil society.

            Every year, ordinary people fall victim to enforced disappearance and vanish without a trace after being arrested, 
            detained, or abducted by government officials or those acting with their tacit assent.  Those responsible often
            refuse to acknowledge the occurrence of disappearances or may even excuse them as part of counter-terrorism 
            activities.  Authoritarian regimes and their proxies try to instill fear and maintain control by disappearing 
            human rights advocates, political activists, environmental defenders, journalists, and other vulnerable groups
            such as children and persons with disabilities.

            The United States renews its commitment to addressing enforced disappearance and calls 
            on governments around the world to put an end to this practice, hold those responsible to account, reveal the
            whereabouts or fate of loved ones who have been disappeared, and respect the
            human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons.
